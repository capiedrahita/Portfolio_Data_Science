# Exploratory Data Analysis - Cybersecurity Incidents

## Description
This project analyzes cybersecurity incidents using real-world data to uncover patterns and insights. The dataset includes information about attack types, severities, and responses.

## Objectives
1. Analyze the distribution of cybersecurity incidents by type and severity.
2. Explore temporal trends in incidents over time.
3. Identify correlations between attributes (e.g., severity, response action, data exfiltrated).
4. Create interactive visualizations to enhance understanding.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repo-link>`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Open and execute the notebook: `notebooks/EDA_Cybersecurity_Incidents.ipynb`

## Results
Key findings and visualizations will be added here as the project progresses.
